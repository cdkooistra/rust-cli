# Rust CLI Tools

A collection of command-line tools recreated in Rust for learning and experimentation.

## Plans

This repository plans to recreate some popular CLI tools, such as:

- `echo` - Print input text to the console.
- `date` - Print formatted datetime
- `cat` - Read and display file contents.
- `ls` - List files in a directory.
- `grep` - Search for patterns in text.

- And more if I have some free time

## Features

- `echo`
    cargo run --bin echo -- -h

- `date`
    cargo run --bin date -- -h
