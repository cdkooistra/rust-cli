# Rust CLI Tools

A collection of command-line tools recreated in Rust for learning and experimentation.

## Plans

This repository plans to recreate some popular CLI tools, such as:

- `echo` - Print input text to the console.
- `cat` - Read and display file contents.
- `ls` - List files in a directory.
- `grep` - Search for patterns in text.
- And more if I have some free time
